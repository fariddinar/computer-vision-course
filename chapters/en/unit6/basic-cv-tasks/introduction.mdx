# Introduction

So far you have learned a lot about different Neural Network architectures for Computer Vision, from CNNs to Transformers, Multimodal architectures and Generative AI.
This unit is meant to give you a better overview of basic Computer Vision tasks, such as _Image Classification_, _Object Detection_ and _Image Segmentation_.

The goal is to get a better understanding of what exactly these tasks are about and which subcategories exist (e.g., Semantic or Instance Segmentation).
We will also highlight popular datasets for these tasks and how they are evaluated. And, of course, we will talk about some of the most popular models that are used for the respective tasks.

## Contributions Welcome

You will notice that this unit so far is a bit short on content. If you want to change that, you are happily invited to join our efforts and have a look at the [Contribution Guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
