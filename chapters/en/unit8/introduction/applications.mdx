# Applications of 3D Vision

3D computer vision enables machines to see and understand their environment in three dimensions, unlocking various applications across numerous industries. In this section, you can find some of the exciting applications of 3D computer vision.

## Robotics and Automation 
+ **Object Manipulation:** 3D vision systems allow robots to precisely identify and grasp objects of varying shapes and sizes. This enables them to perform tasks like picking and placing, assembly and packaging.
+ **Quality Control:** 3D vision systems can be used to inspect manufactured parts and products for defects, ensuring quality and consistency.

## Autonomous Navigation 
+ **Self Driving Cars:** 3D vision cameras and algorithms help with depth perception - information about distances to surrounding objects. This enables self-driving cars to better perceive their environment and navigate safely on roads.  
+ **Autonomous Drones and Robots:** Autonomous drones and robots use 3D computer vision for localizing their position with respect to surroundings, mapping their environment and navigating safely by avoiding obstacles.

## Healthcare
+ **Medical Imaging and Diagnosis:** 3D computer vision is used in medical imaging technologies like CT scans, MRIs, etc. These images help visualize 3D structure of internal body organs, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning and surgical procedures.
+ **Surgical Robotics:** 3D vision systems assist surgeons in performing complex procedures with greater precision and control. 

## AR and VR
+ **Augmented Reality (AR):** AR applications like virtual try on clothing or visualizing furniture in your living space before making a purchase are all enabled by 3D computer vision.
+ **Virtual Reality (VR):** VR experiences which immerse users in a three-dimensional, interactive and often realistic setting are also enabled by 3D computer vision. 

## Entertainment and Gaming
+ **Animation and Motion Capture:** 3D vision systems can track and record human movements, enabling the creation of realistic character animations in movies.
+ **Gaming:** 3D vision allows game developers to create detailed and realistic 3D environments, landscapes, structures, objects with high quality lighting and shadow effects.
